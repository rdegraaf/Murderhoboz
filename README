Murderhoboz!
============

Welcome to Murderhoboz!  This is intended to become a campaign setting compatible with D&D 
3.5/Pathfinder, and eventually maybe its own game system derived from those systems.  It aims to 
discard much of the racist baggage of the classic Tolkienian races and the strict alignment system 
of D&D while preserving the high-fantasy, everyone-is-a-badass feel of the classic settings.

Disclaimers
-----------
While I am trying to avoid the subtle racism that has pervaded much fantasy literature, I am aware 
that this setting remains Anglocentric/Eurocentric.  I draw my ideas from history and literature, 
and I am far more familiar with British and European/Mediterranean history and cultures, and with 
English literature, than I am with history and literature from other parts of the world.  I am 
also aware that this work is awash in stereotypes, tropes, and more than a few silly jokes.
