# Character Classes

The ability to gain class levels based on experiences is part of the Gift of the Guardians; only 
the Accursed, the Valkyr, and certain creatures created since the apotheosis of the Guardians are 
capable of gaining class levels.

## Basic classes

### Expert

Skill-monkey.  Limited combat skills.

### Warrior

Master of weapons and armor

### Berserker

Berserkers are fueled by their rage to achieve great feats of strength and savagery
*   Basic rage
*   Blind rage: stronger, but lose the ability to distinguish between friend and foe.
*   Restrained rage: bonus to intimidate
*   Rage powers:
    -   claws, bite
    -   increase of critical multipliers
    -   reduction in damage taken?
    -   roar: intimidate do social damage to all in range.  Causes fear levels when SHP depleted. 
        Targets resistant to roar for next 30 seconds.  Extra damage to anyone that has attacked 
        or been attacked by the berserker within the past turn.

        Causes fear levels when SHP depleted.  Requires immediate standard action.
    -   Ability to use extremely large weapons with only a small penalty

### Wizard

Wizards are those who've learned to manipulate reality from first principles.  They are smart and 
studious but tend to be weaker and less sociable than others due to their devotion to books and 
studies.

At first level, they gain one level of one spell school (their primary school).  At third level, 
they again a second level of their primary school and a first of a secondary school.  At fifth 
level, they gain a level in their primary and secondary schools and a level in a tertiary school. 
At seventh level and every two levels thereafter, they gain a level in each of their primary, 
secondary, and tertiary schools, along with an additional level that can be applied to any other 
school.

### Sorcerer

Sorcerers are those born with innate magical abilities that they've learned to control and 
channel.  These innate abilities usually firest manifest during adolescence and tend to cause 
uncontrolled magical effects during states of hightened emotions.  Most born with such abilities 
eventually learn to control or at least suppress them; those who don't eventually ends up dead, 
imprisoned, or cast out as a result of the strings of magical catastrophies surrounding them.

### Rogue

Breaks the rules: those of civilized society, those of magic, and eventually those of the world 
itself.

Spell-thievery: steal a random magical effect from the target.  roll Sleight of Hand vs. the 
effect's caster level; on success, that effect now applies to the rogue rather than its original 
target.  No effect on failure or fumble.  Warning: this can result in you stealing a curse, a 
magical disease, or a harmful effect.  Attempting to steal from a mysterious statue or a 
lycanthrope == BAD IDEA

Improved spell-thievery: steal a specific magical effect from the target.  If the target does not 
in fact have that magical effect, nothing happens.

## Oath-bound

### Cleric

More limited spell-casting than a wizard or sorcerer, but also gets a divine minion (summon, 
raised undead, construct, etc. depending on the god)

### Monk

Denial of self allows a monk to draw on a reserve of strange powers.

### Crusader

Get bonuses against the enemies of their gods.  Limited spellcasting from cleric list.  Auras that 
boost allies and weaken enemies: courage, cleansing, etc.
