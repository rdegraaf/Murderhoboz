# Racial Bias

Consider this scenario:

    You descend a steep flight of stairs and open a heavy wooden door to enter 
    a small stone cellar, lit by flickering torches.  Your mother is here, 
    tied securely to a plank that is angled across the room with her head 
    about 1.25 m off the ground and her feet somewhat higher.  Other than the 
    ropes binding her, she is naked.  She looks scared.  She recognizes you, 
    asks what you are doing, and begs you to release her.  You approach her 
    from her left and bite off her nose.  You chew the tough nose for a few 
    minutes, savouring the screams almost as much as the flesh.  You then bite 
    into her cheek and tear out a mouthful.  You appreciate how much more 
    tender and juicy this is than the nose.  You reach across her face and jam 
    your fingers into her right eye-socket to pull out an eyeball, then, in 
    full view of her remaining left eye, pop it into your mouth.  Her screams 
    for help turn to incoherent wails as you bite into it.  Delicious.  You 
    take a step to your right and sink your teeth into her chest.  As a 
    trickle of blood runs down your chin, you consider how appropriate it is 
    that the breast that once nourished you now nourishes you again.

How does that make you feel?  Would you ever, under any circumstances, do that?  That is how a 
creature with a racial bias would treat a suggestion to violate that bias: it's simply 
unthinkable. Even considering violating that bias would be interpreted as insanity.  Anyone who 
actually does so would be considered a mad dog, to be put down for its own good if no suitable 
treatment was possible.

If, for instance, a creature has "Racial Bias: never eats anything yellow", then eating a banana 
would simply never occur to it unless it were deliberately trying to think of something sick and 
disturbing.  Suggesting that it eat a banana would elicit a response similar to yours if someone 
suggested that you enact the above scenario.  You would never persuade it to eat a banana; even if 
you told it that the fate of the world depended on it eating a banana, it would inevitably 
consider the likelihood that you were delusional or under some sort of mind control to be far 
higher than the likelihood that anything good could come of eating that banana.  It would most 
likely never forgive you, and quite likely try to kill you, if you tricked or forced it into 
eating a banana.  Though it might know on an intellectual level that most other races consider it 
normal to eat yellow things, it still finds such behaviour deeply disturbing and probably 
interprets this as evidence of its race's moral superiority.  Eating a banana in its presence 
might cause it to throw up or run away screaming.  Even suggesting that you might eat a banana or 
have done so in the past may cause it to question your sanity and whether you are safe to be 
around.
