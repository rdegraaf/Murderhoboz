# Creature Properties

## Insubstantial creatures and objects

An insubstantial creature cannot interact with a substantial creature, and vice versa, except 
through magic.  To a substantial creature, an insubstantial creature or object appears as a 
transparent image that can pass through substantial things at will.  Insubstantial creatures can 
interact normally with other insubstantial creatures and objects.  Any creature or object with the 
"ghost touch" property is treated as both substantial and insubstantial.

## Spectral creatures

Spectral creatures can be either substantial or insubstantial, and can switch between the two as a 
move action.
