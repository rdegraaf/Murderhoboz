Stats: nine stat, like WoD.  Each of Physical, Mental, and Social groups, crossed with Power, Finesse, and Resilience.


Effortless AC: 10 + deflection (usually magic)
Touch AC: Effortless AC + dodge + parry (shield, some special weapon-parrying abilities)
Full AC: Touch AC + Armor

On attack: roll attack and damage (both modified by size differences)
    If attack hits full AC and attack is not a touch attack:
        Deal full damage (subject to minimum damage)
    Else if attack hits touch AC:
        Deal damage reduced by resistances (subject to minimum damage)
        Deal minimum damage to armor
    Else if attack hits effortless AC:
        Deal minimum damage
    Else:
        No damage

Minimum damage:
    If 1d6 <= damage (this is always true if damage > 5):
        1 point damage
    Else:
        No damage

** This is too complicated.  Re-design.

Result: Two giants fighting use the same rules as two pixies fighting.  But if a giant attacks a pixie, it will have great difficulty hitting but will do overwhelming damage on a successful hit. On the other hand, if the pixie attacks a giant, then it will hit easily but have great difficulty doing damage.


A creature can have one of natural armor, manufactured armor, or magical armor.  Allowing a combination would be OP.  Some effects can enhance armor.

Effortless AC applies even if the creature is helpless.

No DR.  Various things (armor, magic, etc.) can provide resistance to certain kinds of damage.  Natural armor also provides protection in addition to the protection from armor (different sources of protection against the same thing stack).  Some attacks may be able to ignore certain protections that would otherwise apply (this mimics fey and outsider DR)
*   Plate armor provides good protection against piercing, slashing, bludgeoning.
*   Chain provides good protection against slashing, reduced protection against piercing, no protection against bludgeoning
Etc.


Every turn that a creature is in combat, running, or doing other strenuous activities, it takes damage due to fatigue.  Some abilities reduce or eliminate fatigue in some situations.  Being heavily loaded increases this damage


Damage to objects: unattended objects usually don't have any deflection or armor, never have parry, and their dodge is always -5.  However, objects may have high natural armor.  If an object is attended (held, worn, etc.), then the attender's deflection, dodge, and parry apply.


Some things (usually objects and creatures of homogeneous substance) have extremely high or even perfect natural armor.  However, attacks can still beat their touch AC and deal damage reduced by their natural resistances.


It's possible to have lots of stamina.  Stamina is easy to heal, easy to recover.  If you're out of stamina, you start taking hit point damage.  Hit points are difficult to increase and damage to them is not easily healed.  In most cases when physical damage causes hit point loss, the victim can choose to take a random wound instead in place of up to 1d6 damage.

Called shots: you pick a wound to inflict and attack.  If you score a critical hit, you inflict the chosen wound (in addition to dealing damage as per a normal critical hit).  If you do not score a critical hit, you do no damage.

Critical hits: A raise on an attack is known as a "critical hit".  In addition to normal damage, you also inflict a random wound.  Depending on your weapon and abilities, critical hits may also have additional effects.

    19    Bleeding                Lose one hit point per turn, stopped by magical healing or heal check.  You may not take an additional wound to offset this.
    20    Flayed                  Lose a large amount of skin.  Extra vulnerable to disease and environmental conditions

If you have wings instead of arms, a broken arm prevents you from flying.  If you have both wings *and* arms, your wings can be wounded as well as your arms.  If you somehow have more than two arms, legs, or eyes, or more than one mouth, then those body parts can be wounded as well.  If you have more than two legs or wings, you may still be able to stand, walk, or fly even with a wound to one, though at a penalty.

**Bleeding wound: too powerful?
**Other suggestions: Confused (penalty to WIS), penalties to other stats

Skill checks:

All skill checks are bonus + d20.  A roll of 1 is treated as -4; a roll of 20 is treated as +25.  You get a raise for every 5 by which you exceed the check's DC.  A negative result means a fumble.

You can always choose to "take 1".  This means that you do not roll a d20 and instead add 1 to your bonus.  Most subconscious skill checks are on a "take 1" basis, such as not stabbing yourself in the face with a fork while eating, not tripping over obvious obstacles, and hearing your name being called.  Some feats (e.g., Trained Observer) allow characters to perform subconscious checks at higher levels.  Failure on a "take 1" test is still subject to fumbles.

  For instance, Alex has a +9 to Swim and needs to cross a slow-flowing river.  Alex believes that the check is no more difficult than DC 10, so declares a "take 1" to cross it.  If Alex was correct about the DC, then the check automatically succeeds.

If you have plenty of time and can be very careful, one can "take 20".  This means that you do not roll a d20 and instead add 20 to your bonus.  This process generally takes 20 times as long as a normal skill check and therefore usually cannot be done in combat, contested scenarios, or anything involving time constraints.  "Take 20" checks may cost additional resources besides time, depending on the check.


Linguistics: 
    Language proficiencies:
    *   Basic: "Hello, my name is Bob."  "Where is the bathroom?"  "How much for this?".  Etc.  You can understand simple messages spoken slowly to you, but overheard conversation is mostly a blur.
    *   Conversational: You can converse, but you sometimes need to ask for help with a word, your phrasing may be odd, etc.  Your speech and reading are conspicuously slow (DC 0 linguistics check to notice).
    *   Fluent:  You speak the language well and rarely need help with vocabulary.  However, your accent and other factors give away that this is not your first language (DC 10 linguistics check to notice).
    *   Native: As far as anyone can tell, this is your first language.
    
    Learning a language is hard.  Acquiring basic proficiency is a DC 25 linguistics check.  Conversational is DC 50 for someone with basic, fluent is DC 100 for someone conversational, and native is DC 200 for someone fluent.  Spending one hour learning a language from someone with higher proficiency and a DC 10 linguistics check reduces the DC to improve proficiency in that language by 1.  Spending two hours studying from an appropriate book and a DC 10 linguistics check likewise reduces the DC by 1.  So someone with +5 to Linguistics can expect to acquire basic proficiency after 5 hours studying with a fluent speaker and 10 hours studying from a book (d20 + 5 vs. DC 25 - 5 - 5).
    
    Most linguistics checks assume a fluent speaker.  If you're a native speaker of that language, you gain a +5 to the check.  On the other hand, a conversational speaker takes a -10, a basic speaker takes -20, and a non-speaker takes -40. 
    
    On average, a sentence takes a fluent speaker one turn to speak or read.  A page takes a fluent reader one minute to read.  Very simple things (for example, children's books) may be faster and very complicated things (eg, spellbooks) may be slower.
    
    Prepared Actions: spend a turn puzzling over a sentence to get a +1 bonus on a linguistics check to interpret that sentence.  Requires at least basic proficiency in the language.  The maximum bonus between prepared actions and Aid Another is +10.  Failing a linguistics check by five or more after applying a prepared action bonus results in a misinterpretation.
    ** Call this something else?  There's nothing "prepared" about this.
    
    Aid Another: spend a turn puzzling over a sentence with someone with the same proficiency in the language and who successfully makes a DC 10 linguistics check to get a +2 bonus to interpret that sentence.  Requires both parties to have at least basic proficiency in the language.  The maximum bonus between prepared actions and Aid Another is +10.  Failing a linguistics check by five or more after applying an aid another bonus results in a misinterpretation.
    
    Resources: Spending a turn discussing with a character that successfully interpreted a sentence gives a +2 bonus to interpret that sentence -- though a character that misinterpreted the sentence and doesn't know it gives a -2 penalty.  Spending a minute with an appropriate book (dictionary, translation manual, etc.) gives a +5 bonus.  This bonus can be repeated as many times as desired.
    
    However, in most cases, someone with at least basic proficiency can spend a turn puzzling over a sentence with a DC 10 linguistics check to reduce the total DC by 1 -- though if you do this, a failed check may give an incorrect interpretation.
    ** This paragraph is redundant?
    
    Learning languages may automatically give lower proficiencies in related languages/dialects or bonuses to learning related languages/dialects.
