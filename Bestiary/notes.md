## Creatures

*   A fish with steel-like scales, lives in the north
*   Vulza -- dragon-like, but no fire breathing and animal intelligence
*   Sump thing
*   Yellow musk creeper, creates yellow musk keepers.  Actually a fungus.
*   Bombfruit
*   Wood that spontaneously combusts
*   Murderpigs
*   Bloodvine: fast-growing, drives into flesh
*   Carnivorous plant whose magical odour forces people (as by Suggestion) to seek out its source, where they get ensnared and consumed
*   Psionic plant with psychotopric scent and feeds on fear
*   Mistletoe-like parasitic plant (don't stand underneath it!).  Barbed seeds brush off onto passing animals; they penetrate the skin and grow a root structure that feeds off the host to produce multiple plant embryos that erupt through the skin and brush off.  The ideal host is a flying or tree-climbing creature, but it isn't choosy.
*   Drop-bears
*   zenomorph-like wasps?  Other horrifying wasp monsters?
*   Ogres: like to eat sentient creatures because they covet their higher intelligence and "you are what you eat".  Or maybe give this to cyclopses or some other monstrous humanoid race?
*   need an "ogres are like onions" joke
*   Ghouls: slightly better than animal intelligence.  Driven to consume the flesh of their species to repair their bodies; if they don't, they rot and "die".
*   Beholders:  Characterized by their eyes.  They are easily distracted by beautiful things and will never break or damage something beautiful.  Their standards of beauty are a little odd, though.
*   Undead plants?  What's the use?
