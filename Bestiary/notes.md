## Creatures

*   A fish with steel-like scales, lives in the north
*   Vulza -- dragon-like, but no fire breathing and animal intelligence
*   Sump thing
*   Yellow musk creeper, creates yellow musk keepers.  Actually a fungus.
*   Bombfruit
*   Wood that spontaneously combusts.  You do *not* want to build anything important out of it.
*   Murderpigs
*   Bloodvine: fast-growing, drives into flesh
*   Carnivorous plant whose magical odour forces people (as by Suggestion) to seek out its source, where they get ensnared and consumed
*   Psionic plant with psychotopric scent that feeds on fear
*   Mistletoe-like parasitic plant (don't stand underneath it!).  Barbed seeds brush off onto passing animals; they penetrate the skin and grow a root structure that feeds off the host to produce multiple plant embryos that erupt through the skin and brush off.  The ideal host is a flying or tree-climbing creature, but it isn't choosy.
*   Drop-bears
*   zenomorph-like wasps?  Other horrifying wasp monsters?
*   Ogres: like to eat sentient creatures because they covet their higher intelligence and "you are what you eat".  Or maybe give this to cyclopses or some other monstrous humanoid race?
*   need an "ogres are like onions" joke
*   Ghouls: slightly better than animal intelligence.  Driven to consume the flesh of their species to repair their bodies; if they don't, they rot and "die".
*   Beholders:  Characterized by their eyes.  They are easily distracted by beautiful things and will never break or damage something beautiful.  Their standards of beauty are a little odd, though.
*   Undead plants?  What's the use?
*   Dragons are very light for their size to allow flight.  They are weak, but their natural attacks count as enchanted weapons.  Low HP, high AC, lots of resistances.  Unusual attacks can be effective (blow them away with strong wind?).
*   Alternate dragons: they can produce large quantities of hydrogen gas very quickly.  They can either keep it in an internal reservoir which gives them buoyancy to permit flight, or blow it out.  A gland in their mouths can ignite the hydrogen, giving them their famous fire breath.  However, a dragon that uses fire breath while flying will lose buoyancy and semi-fall (sort of like a person in a wingsuit).  Regenerating the hydrogen takes several rounds, so it's a bad idea to use breath in flight unless there's lots of room to recover.
*   Chameleon: disguises itself as more dangerous creatures.  Illusion only.
*   Dire rabbit
