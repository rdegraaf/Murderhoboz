## The Djinn

The first children of the Gods, the djinn have inherent magic that was stripped from the Accursed. 
In addition to various magical abilities that differ based on race, they all have magical auras 
that alter the world around them to suit their tastes and moods.  This aura is very weak and has 
little effect over short periods of time.  Over time spans of weeks to months, it tends to make an 
area of activity feel more comfortable to a djinni even though it has little noticable effect. 
Over years and more, especially if there are many like-minded djinn about, it can start to 
seriously warp reality.  As demonstrated by the raising of the Guardians, sufficient djinn 
believing that something is a god, or at least wanting it to be a god, can be enough to create a 
new god.

The down-side of this power is that once a djinni has spent more than a year or so in a place, 
anywhere else starts to feel distinctly uncomfortable.  The same applies to tasks and occupations. 
As a result, most djinn get stuck in ruts, so to speak: they never leave their home regions and 
never try anything new.  Nearly all djinn live in the Isles of the Sun; they are rarely seen 
elsewhere.  Any djinn seen outside of the Isles of the Sun are usually very young.


Can channel their reality-warping power into a wish, but since this leaves them feeling drained for 
about a year, they only do this when they have a really good reason.

Long life-spans.  Slow reproduction.
