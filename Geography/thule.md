## Thule

Denonym: Thulian

Thule is a land defined by its laws.  It has a vast body of law and legal precedent regulating 
just about everything.  Most of the laws are intended to prevent various sorts of abuses that have 
been invented over the centuries; given that Thule is one of the oldest states in the world, it 
has quite a long time to build up laws.  As a result, most people can go about their business with 
only a vague understanding of that law without seriously risk of violating anything important, but 
woe unto the one that tries some "trick" to cut costs or take advantage of someone without a deep 
understanding of the law.  The laws are also sufficiently broad and complex that nearly everyone 
is guilty of *something*, even if no charges have ever been laid.

Thule is formally ruled by a king and council of advisors.  The state us divided into a hierarchy 
of duchies, counties, and baronies with various powers devolved to each level.  In practice, the 
courts, which have a similar hierarchy, have almost as much influence over the country as the 
government.  The king and council, and to a lesser extent the leaders and councils of the regional 
governments, create laws and maintain the police and bureaucracies to enforce them; the courts 
interpret the laws, establish and enforce precedents, and mete out punishments.  The kingship is 
hereditary.  Dukedoms, countships, and baronships are also hereditary but can be replaced by the 
king and council.  Council members must be approved by the courts.  Court appointments are made by 
the king and council.

Each district is responsible for maintaining its own military units: a barony maintains a 
battalion, a county a division, and a duchy an army.  Districts along the Dragonal border (and a 
few others) are also responsible for maintaining fortifications.  The full Thulian army is vast, 
but only a small portion is permanently on duty; in peace-time, the majority are reservists who 
are only mustered for duty a few weeks out of every year.

Thule is hilly and lacks navigable rivers, so travel is nearly all by road.  They pride themselves 
on the best road network in the world.  Combined with a network of stables and supply depots, this 
allows them to rapidly move troops anywhere within their borders with ease.  Building on their 
infrastructure expertise, they also have many dams, canals, and aqueducts to ensure that every 
part of the country has adequate supplies of clean water.

After the dragon-lands, Thule is the only major region in the world to practice slavery.  However, 
the differences between Dragonal and Thulian slavery are vast.  There is a huge body of laws 
governing the treatment of slaves, preventing many of the abuses that Dragonal slaves are subject 
to.  Thulian slaves are divided into three classes, to whom slightly different rules apply: 
thralls, bondservants, and serfs.  (Technically, conscripts are a fourth class of slaves, but 
Thule only practices conscription during serious crises; while legal mechanisms for conscription 
are still maintained, they have not been used in generations.)

Some laws applying to Thulian slaves:

*   A slave may not be required to perform more than 60 hours of labour per week or 12 hours per 
    day.  Outside of this, slaves are permitted to do most things, including work for pay 
    elsewhere.  Certain allowances must be made for slaves who are injured, ill, infirm, or are 
    taking care of young children (as appropriate for the species).
*   A bondservant must earn a certain minimum wage, to be paid against it debt, per hour worked. 
    Skilled labour earns a higher wage than unskilled.
*   Slaves are permitted to own personal property.  Masters have no rights over this property.
*   Slaves must be provided certain minimum food, shelter, clothing, and other necessities.  These 
    may not be deducted from the pay of an bondservant.
*   There is a standard rate of interest on the debts of bondservants.
*   A bondservant may make additional payments against its debt at any time.  Once the debt is 
    paid, any bondservants held under that debt must be freed immediately.
*   No thrall or serf may be unilaterally freed without its consent.
*   Thralls and serfs may buy their freedom.  They may sue to determine their values, and if they 
    can obtain adequate funds, their payment must be accepted by their masters and they must be 
    freed immediately.
*   When a thrall or serf reaches the age of majority, if one parent is free (or was free at time 
    of death), then the thrall or serf must be freed.
*   There are strict rules and limits on how slaves may be punished.  Slaves may not be raped or 
    killed by their masters.
*   Punishments for crimes against slaves may include restitution to their masters to compensate 
    for lost productivity.  A perpetrator who cannot afford restitution may be forced into 
    bondage.  If a perpetrator cannot afford restitution and is already a thrall or serf and is 
    not a minor with a free parent (and therefore cannot be bonded), things get messy.
*   Serfs' labour is only required on specific parcels of land.  If no labour is needed on that 
    land at a point in time (for instance, there's little to do on cropland in the winter), then 
    serfs may not be forced to labour elsewhere.  Serfs' bound lands must be contiguous and there 
    is a limit to the size.
*   Time spent travelling from a slaves' domicile to place of work must be counted as work time. 
    Masters are responsible for any necessary travel costs.

Unlike in many countries, debts are inheritable.  There is a standard system for allocating assets 
and debts to the relatives of a deceased person.  No sensible person will accept any significant 
debt without an agreed-upon chain of inheritance.  There is a minor industry in tracing family 
trees and tracking down nexts of kin (and also in forging or concealing relationships).  Since 
tracing families is easier for some species than others, undine and dryants find it much harder to 
obtain credit than ignans, sylphs, thanays, ~~metal accursed~~, and oreads.  There are relatively 
few undine in Thule, but the substantial dryant population often feel like second-class citizens 
as a result.
