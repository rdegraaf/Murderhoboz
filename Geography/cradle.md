## The Cradle

North of Enalia and fed the rivers pouring off the western slopes of the Bones lies the vast wetland known as The Cradle.  As the name implies, this region is brimming with life.  However, that life is fiercely competitive, so the region is brimming with danger as well.

The population consists of a mix of undine, thanays, and dryants who live in small villages of mud and thatch huts on dryer islands in the swamp.  Conflicts between villages are rare; it's more common for them to beg assistance from each other to stave off some calamity.
