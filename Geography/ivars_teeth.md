## Ivar's Teeth

This mountain range defines much of the border between the dragon-lands and Thule.  Most of the 
passes hold Thulian forts that were built with the assistance of Elvani engineers during the Long 
War.  They were largely successful at keeping Ivar from moving in force through the mountains; 
nearly all major attacks into Thule passed through Jidan instead.  However, the upkeep of this 
network of fortifications was extremely expensive; most are no longer permanently garrisoned and 
many are falling into ruin.

Prior to the Long War, Thule had little interest in the mountains which were then known as "The 
Dragon's Crest".  They were generally controlled by various dragon-states and were the site of 
several Dragonal strongholds.
