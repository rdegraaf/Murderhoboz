# The World

The world is the interior surface of a hollow prolate spheroid.  Gravity is a repulsive effect 
centering on the Sun, which a sphere at the center of the world.  The brightness of the sun 
pulsates on several scales.  The most obvious is the daily scale, wherein it oscillates between 
maximum and minimum brightness.  Next most obvious is the 30-day minimum-brightness scale, in 
which the minimum solar brightness varies between dim light and no light at all.  Then there is 
the 360-day maximum-brightness scale wherein the sun's maximum brightness varies by 50%, and 
finally the 365-day day-length scale.  While the other three scales vary continuously, the daily 
oscillation does not: the sun takes six hours to transition from minimum to maximum brightness, 
remains at that level for a duration based on the day-length scale, then takes six hours to 
transition back to minimum brightness.  These six-hour transition periods are based on the times 
of sunrise and sunset; if the day length is less than 12 hours, the sun will start dimming while 
it is still brightening and will never reach maximum brightness.  TKTK: this needs some tweaking

Due to the day-length scale, the world has distinct seasons, though all parts of it experience the 
same seasons at the same time.  In polar areas, weather is cool in the summer and frigid in 
winter; plants can only grow in the summer.  In equatorial areas, weather is warm in the winter 
and hot in the summer; some plants go dormant in the summer to avoid the extreme heat.  Summers 
when the maximum day length corresponds with the maximum solar brightness are particularly hot; 
winters when the minimum day length corresponds with the minimum solar brightness are particularly 
cold.

Most of the rest of the world is visible in the sky.  Because of this, many people know more about 
lands thousands of km away than they know of lands only a few tens of km away.  There are many 
superstitions about what lies directly behind the sun.

It is unknown what lies "outside" of the world.  To some, that very question is blasphemy.  Some 
claim that either the outside of the world is equivalent to the outside of the universe, or that 
the ground must extend infinitely downwards; anything else would result in the world falling apart 
due to gravity.  Others believe that the ground has finite depth, though digging through it would 
be a bad idea.  One fear is that digging through it would result in one falling forever through 
a void outside of the world.  Another is that penetrating the dome of the ground would let all of 
the air out into the void below.  The followers Kote promote the belief that digging through the 
ground will destroy its structural integrity, breaking it for a second time and resulting in the 
deaths of everyone and everything; they may like breaking things, but they aren't nihilists, so 
they actively persecute anyone attempting to tunnel outside of the world.

Some have sought to fly to the sun (mainly at night when it is not so incredibly hot).  None is 
known to have succeeded, due to the strengthening of gravity with altitude and the decreasing 
amount of air available.
