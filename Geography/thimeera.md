## Thimeera

Denonym: Thimmeran

Everyone is Thimeera has an Uncle.  Not necessarily a parent's brother (though many have those too), but an "Uncle": someone wealthier and more powerful with ties to one of the "Families".  Uncles aren't necessarily male or even of the same species as their "Nieces" and "Nephews".  The Families are the the wealthiest and most powerful people in the country and their entourages; a self-appointed council of the Families serves as Thimeera's government.  All levels of society are deeply corrupt.  Getting anything done requires influence, and getting access to that influence requires the exchange of favours or bribes.

Thimeera's body of laws mostly concerns limits on rent-seeking to keep the economy moving, limits on violence between Families, and maintenance of their Navy and control over trade routes.  Punishments are almost all financial.  Government revenue comes exclusively from tolls on the Southern Trade Route and from fines.  There is such a thing as a "lawful murder": if you've given your prospective victim adequate notice or have received the approval of the victim's Family, then your victim is fair game.

Thimeera is the most racially diverse of the major nations of the world.  Despite the corruption, its social structure is more meritocratic than most: anyone able to gather wealth and influence can get ahead.  Inherited power is limited by the custom of giving away one's wealth to one's Nieces and Nephews upon death.

Thimeera is a major trading nation, controlling most of the southern trade route and being the preeminent naval power in the Ocean.  Their major rivals are Facci, which controls the northern terminus of the southern trade route, and Eosahai, which controls the only major alternate route between the Ocean and Sea.

Despite the radically different approaches to law and order between Thule and Thimeera, the two neighbouring nations have long enjoyed friendly relations.  Generally, they recognize each other's rights to live their lives their own ways and put limits on the sorts of things that might offend each other.  It certainly doesn't hurt that their national interests do not conflict in any significant way: Thule is preoccupied with the Dragon-States and its domestic economy, while Thimeera's border disputes involve Facci and the Babel region and they are more concerned with overseas colonies and international trade.

Some key rules that summarize the Thimeeran mindset:

*   Rules are for chumps
*   Enough gold can smooth over any transgression
*   Be kind to your friends and ruthless to your enemies
*   Nothing makes friends faster than generosity
