## Jidan

Denonym: Jida

Prior to the Long War, Jida was an independent state populated primarily by Dryants.  It was then 
Ivar's first conquest outside of the Dragon-lands: his army burned, looted, and enslaved everyone 
and everything save those that escaped into Thule.  Then Thule counter-invaded and the region 
changed hands dozens of times over the centuries of the Long War.  Thule preserved the fiction of 
an independent Jida in the regions that they controlled (roughly the southern third of the 
country) for a while but it was always subject to Thulian military rule and eventually Thule 
formally annexed it.  It currently has some autonomy as the Duchy of Jida, but its leadership is 
appointed by the central Thulian government and generally favours Thulian interests over Jida 
ones.  A vocal minority within the region supports an armed Jidan Independence Movement (JIM). 
The northern two thirds remains under the control of the Dragon-States and retains essentially no 
native Jidan population; the JIM has a long-term goal of regaining control over that region as 
well, but their primary goal is full independence from Thule.
