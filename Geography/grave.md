## The Grave

East of the Bones lies the desert known as The Grave.  Few streams descend the eastern slopes of the mountains, and those are quickly lost among the sands.  Some areas may see rain only once per generation.  Few people live here.  War among them for the best grazing land and access to oases is a constant threat.
