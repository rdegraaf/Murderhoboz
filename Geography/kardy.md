## Kardy

Denonym: Kardian

In the northwest lies Kardy, a land populated by many tribes and many races.  No long-lived 
central government has ever controlled Kardy.  Its inhabitants organize themselves into a number 
of tribes, each ruled by a judge-king whose title more accurately translates to "Keeper of the 
Traditions".  Traditions govern all aspects of life in Kardy: where to live, what crops to grow, 
what to wear, who to marry, what gods to worship, etc.  In most tribes, Keepers have no authority 
to create law, only to apply it.  New laws (traditions) can only be created or old ones overturned 
by a tribal council known as a "Thing", though the specifics of the legislative process differ 
significantly between tribes.  In most tribes, creating, changing, or revoking a tradition is a 
big deal; most tribes only hold a few Things per generation.  Most tribes also allow individual 
families to have their own traditions, which are created and enforced by similar processes. 

Most tribes take a dim view of forsaking the tribe of one's ancestors, but some welcome converts 
with open arms.  The ~~placeholder~~ tribe goes so far as to ban anyone who was born a member from 
marrying anyone else who was born a member.  Occasionally, a tribe splits due to a dispute over 
traditions or disbands due to lack of members.

Kardian tribes are known for their feuds.  It might take a tribe years of debate to decide to go 
to war, but once declared, that war is likely to last generations unless interrupted by the total 
extinction of one of the participants.  Peaceful ends to feuds are usually celebrated with 
elaborate ceremonies.  Individual family feuds are smaller in scale but no less long-lasting.

The Reivers are understood to have originated a Kardian tribe before their depredations convinced 
their neighbours, and eventually every other tribe in Kardy, to institute traditions of war 
against them.  This condition normally would have spelled the end of the tribe, but the Reivers 
had no need for a homeland and broke up into small bands of nomadic raiders that eventually 
dispersed throughout the world.  Most tribes maintain their traditions of war so long as a single 
Reiver lives; while most limit themselves to keeping the Reivers out of Kardy, a few maintain war-
bands that travel throughout the world, fighting the Reivers wherever they can be found.

Key traditions of the Reivers include:
*   Only the weak build tend crops or practice crafts; the strong take what they will.
*   Take no more than you can use; do not kill or destroy unnecessarily.  Allow the herd to re-
    grow to supply you again.
*   Form no attachments to land, property, or people.  Everything can be discarded and everything 
    can be replaced.
*   Anyone who follows the traditions of the Reivers is a Reiver.

Another well-known tribe is "The Nine Bows".  They live near Eosahai and accuse the Eosahi of 
encroaching into their territory.  They sometimes raid outlying farms or attack ships on the 
Northern Trade Route.  They are known for their skills in archery.
